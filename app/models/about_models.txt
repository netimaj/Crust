Model files represent database tables and since Crust employs Doctrine ORM to
access DB, simply go under app/bootstrap.php and uncomment the block defining database connection
and once you have done, you should see model files generated automatically under this folder.

Do not forget to comment out the following line once you're done with creating models:
	> Doctrine_Core::generateModelsFromDb(DIR_MODELS, array('Doctrine'), array('generateTableClasses' => true));
	in app/bootstrap.php
	

Access model files freely from controllers as simple as
	> $users = new Users();
	for a table called Users.
	
Do not forget that doctrine remove any underscores from the table names and capitalize letters following them.
For example
	> profile_pictures would be renamed as ProfilePictures
	
Never forget to refer to that table as ProfilePictures as Doctrine ORM abstracts the database and employs the models it has
and does not actually care about the real names you have in your MySQL panel.
